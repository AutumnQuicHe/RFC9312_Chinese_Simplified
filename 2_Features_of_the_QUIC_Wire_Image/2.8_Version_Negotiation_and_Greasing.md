Version Negotiation packets are used by the server to indicate that a requested version from the client is not supported (see Section 6 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]). Version Negotiation packets are not intrinsically protected, but future QUIC versions could use later encrypted messages to verify that they were authentic. Therefore, any modification of this list will be detected and may cause the endpoints to terminate the connection attempt.

Also note that the list of versions in the Version Negotiation packet may contain reserved versions. This mechanism is used to avoid ossification in the implementation of the selection mechanism. Further, a client may send an Initial packet with a reserved version number to trigger version negotiation. In the Version Negotiation packet, the connection IDs of the client's Initial packet are reflected to provide a proof of return-routability. Therefore, changing this information will also cause the connection to fail.

QUIC is expected to evolve rapidly. Therefore, new versions (both experimental and IETF standard versions) will be deployed on the Internet more often than with other commonly deployed Internet and transport-layer protocols. Use of the Version field for traffic recognition will therefore behave differently than with these protocols. Using a particular version number to recognize valid QUIC traffic is likely to persistently miss a fraction of QUIC flows and completely fail in the near future. Reliance on the Version field for the purpose of admission control is also likely to lead to unintended failure modes. Admission of QUIC traffic regardless of version avoids these failure modes, avoids unnecessary deployment delays, and supports continuous version-based evolution.
