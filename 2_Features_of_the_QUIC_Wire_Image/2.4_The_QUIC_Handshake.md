New QUIC connections are established using a handshake that is distinguishable on the wire (see Section 3.1 for details) and contains some information that can be passively observed.

To illustrate the information visible in the QUIC wire image during the handshake, we first show the general communication pattern visible in the UDP datagrams containing the QUIC handshake. Then, we examine each of the datagrams in detail.

The QUIC handshake can normally be recognized on the wire through four flights of datagrams labeled "Client Initial", "Server Initial", "Client Completion", and "Server Completion" as illustrated in Figure 1.

A handshake starts with the client sending one or more datagrams containing Initial packets (detailed in Figure 2), which elicits the Server Initial response (detailed in Figure 3), which typically contains three types of packets: Initial packet(s) with the beginning of the server's side of the TLS handshake, Handshake packet(s) with the rest of the server's portion of the TLS handshake, and 1-RTT packet(s), if present.

Figure 1: General Communication Pattern Visible in the QUIC Handshake
As shown here, the client can send 0-RTT data as soon as it has sent its ClientHello and the server can send 1-RTT data as soon as it has sent its ServerHello. The Client Completion flight contains at least one Handshake packet and could also include an Initial packet. During the handshake, QUIC packets in separate contexts can be coalesced (see Section 2.2) in order to reduce the number of UDP datagrams sent during the handshake.

Handshake packets can arrive out-of-order without impacting the handshake as long as the reordering was not accompanied by extensive delays that trigger a spurious Probe Timeout (Section 6.2 of [QUIC-RECOVERY]). If QUIC packets get lost or reordered, packets belonging to the same flight might not be observed in close time succession, though the sequence of the flights will not change because one flight depends upon the peer's previous flight.

Datagrams that contain an Initial packet (Client Initial, Server Initial, and some Client Completion) contain at least 1200 octets of UDP payload. This protects against amplification attacks and verifies that the network path meets the requirements for the minimum QUIC IP packet size; see Section 14 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]. This is accomplished by either adding PADDING frames within the Initial packet, coalescing other packets with the Initial packet, or leaving unused payload in the UDP packet after the Initial packet. A network path needs to be able to forward packets of at least this size for QUIC to be used.

The content of Initial packets is encrypted using Initial Secrets, which are derived from a per-version constant and the client's Destination Connection ID. That content is therefore observable by any on-path device that knows the per-version constant and is considered visible in this illustration. The content of QUIC Handshake packets is encrypted using keys established during the initial handshake exchange and is therefore not visible.

Initial, Handshake, and 1-RTT packets belong to different cryptographic and transport contexts. The Client Completion (Figure 4) and the Server Completion (Figure 5) flights conclude the Initial and Handshake contexts by sending final acknowledgments and CRYPTO frames.

Figure 2: Example Client Initial Datagram Without 0-RTT
A Client Initial packet exposes the Version, Source, and Destination Connection IDs without encryption. The payload of the Initial packet is protected using the Initial secret. The complete TLS ClientHello, including any TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) present, is sent in one or more CRYPTO frames across one or more QUIC Initial packets.

The Server Initial datagram also exposes the version number and the Source and Destination Connection IDs in the clear; the payload of the Initial packet is protected using the Initial secret.

Figure 4: Coalesced Client Completion Datagram Pattern
The Client Completion flight does not expose any additional information; however, as the Destination Connection ID is server-selected, it usually is not the same ID that is sent in the Client Initial. Client Completion flights contain 1-RTT packets that indicate the handshake has completed (see Section 3.2) on the client and for three-way handshake RTT estimation as in Section 3.8.

Figure 5: Coalesced Server Completion Datagram Pattern
Similar to Client Completion, Server Completion does not expose additional information; observing it serves only to determine that the handshake has completed.

When the client uses 0-RTT data, the Client Initial flight can also include one or more 0-RTT packets as shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6: Coalesced 0-RTT Client Initial Datagram
When a 0-RTT packet is coalesced with an Initial packet, the datagram will be padded to 1200 bytes. Additional datagrams containing only 0-RTT packets with long headers can be sent after the client Initial packet, which contains more 0-RTT data. The amount of 0-RTT protected data that can be sent in the first flight is limited by the initial congestion window, typically to around 10 packets (see Section 7.2 of [QUIC-RECOVERY]).
