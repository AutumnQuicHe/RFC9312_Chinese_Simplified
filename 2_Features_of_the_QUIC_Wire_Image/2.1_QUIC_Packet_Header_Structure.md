QUIC packets may have either a long header or a short header. The first bit of the QUIC header is the Header Form bit and indicates which type of header is present. The purpose of this bit is invariant across QUIC versions.

The long header exposes more information. It contains a version number, as well as Source and Destination Connection IDs for associating packets with a QUIC connection. The definition and location of these fields in the QUIC long header are invariant for future versions of QUIC, although future versions of QUIC may provide additional fields in the long header [QUIC-INVARIANTS].

In version 1 of QUIC, the long header is used during connection establishment to transmit CRYPTO handshake data, perform version negotiation, retry, and send 0-RTT data.

Short headers are used after a connection establishment in version 1 of QUIC and expose only an optional Destination Connection ID and the initial flags byte with the spin bit for RTT measurement.

The following information is exposed in QUIC packet headers in all versions of QUIC (as specified in [QUIC-INVARIANTS]):

version number:
The version number is present in the long header and identifies the version used for that packet. During Version Negotiation (see Section 17.2.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT] and Section 2.8), the Version field has a special value (0x00000000) that identifies the packet as a Version Negotiation packet. QUIC version 1 uses version 0x00000001. Operators should expect to observe packets with other version numbers as a result of various Internet experiments, future standards, and greasing [RFC7801]. An IANA registry contains the values of all standardized versions of QUIC, and may contain some proprietary versions (see Section 22.2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]). However, other versions of QUIC can be expected to be seen in the Internet at any given time.
Source and Destination Connection ID:
Short and long headers carry a Destination Connection ID, which is a variable-length field. If the Destination Connection ID is not zero length, it can be used to identify the connection associated with a QUIC packet for load balancing and NAT rebinding purposes; see Sections 4.4 and 2.6. Long packet headers additionally carry a Source Connection ID. The Source Connection ID is only present on long headers and indicates the Destination Connection ID that the other endpoint should use when sending packets. On long header packets, the length of the connection IDs is also present; on short header packets, the length of the Destination Connection ID is implicit, as it is known from preceding long header packets.
In version 1 of QUIC, the following additional information is exposed:

"Fixed Bit":
In version 1 of QUIC, the second-most-significant bit of the first octet is set to 1, unless the packet is a Version Negotiation packet or an extension is used that modifies the usage of this bit. If the bit is set to 1, it enables endpoints to easily demultiplex with other UDP-encapsulated protocols. Even though this bit is fixed in the version 1 specification, endpoints might use an extension that varies the bit [QUIC-GREASE]. Therefore, observers cannot reliably use it as an identifier for QUIC.
latency spin bit:
The third-most-significant bit of the first octet in the short header for version 1. The spin bit is set by endpoints such that tracking edge transitions can be used to passively observe end-to-end RTT. See Section 3.8.2 for further details.
header type:
The long header has a 2-bit packet type field following the Header Form and Fixed Bits. Header types correspond to stages of the handshake; see Section 17.2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT] for details.
length:
The length of the remaining QUIC packet after the Length field present on long headers. This field is used to implement coalesced packets during the handshake (see Section 2.2).
token:
Initial packets may contain a token, a variable-length opaque value optionally sent from client to server, used for validating the client's address. Retry packets also contain a token, which can be used by the client in an Initial packet on a subsequent connection attempt. The length of the token is explicit in both cases.
Retry (Section 17.2.5 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]) and Version Negotiation (Section 17.2.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]) packets are not encrypted. Retry packets are integrity protected. Transport parameters are used to authenticate the contents of Retry packets later in the handshake. For other kinds of packets, version 1 of QUIC cryptographically protects other information in the packet headers:

Packet Number:
All packets except Version Negotiation and Retry packets have an associated packet number; however, this packet number is encrypted, and therefore not of use to on-path observers. The offset of the packet number can be decoded in long headers while it is implicit (depending on Destination Connection ID length) in short headers. The length of the packet number is cryptographically protected.
Key Phase:
The Key Phase bit (present in short headers) specifies the keys used to encrypt the packet to support key rotation. The Key Phase bit is cryptographically protected.
