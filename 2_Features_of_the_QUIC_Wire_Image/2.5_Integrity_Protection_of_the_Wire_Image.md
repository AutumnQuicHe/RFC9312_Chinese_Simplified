As soon as the cryptographic context is established, all information in the QUIC header, including exposed information, is integrity protected. Further, information that was exposed in packets sent before the cryptographic context was established is validated during the cryptographic handshake. Therefore, devices on path cannot alter any information or bits in QUIC packets. Such alterations would cause the integrity check to fail, which results in the receiver discarding the packet. Some parts of Initial packets could be altered by removing and reapplying the authenticated encryption without immediate discard at the receiver. However, the cryptographic handshake validates most fields and any modifications in those fields will result in a connection establishment failure later.

一旦建立起加密上下文，QUIC头部中的所有信息，包括暴露出来的那些，就都会受到完整性保护。此外，在加密上下文建立前发送的数据包中暴露的信息会在加密握手过程中得到验证。因此，在路径上的设备无法篡改QUIC数据包中的任何信息或比特位。这类篡改将无法通过完整性检查，导致接收方丢弃数据包。可以通过移除或重新应用认证加密的方法修改初始数据包中的某些部分而不会导致接收方立即丢弃数据包。然而，加密握手会对绝大多数字段进行验证，对这些字段的任何篡改都将造成稍后的连接建立过程失败。
