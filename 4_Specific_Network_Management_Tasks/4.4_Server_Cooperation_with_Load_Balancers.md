In the case of networking architectures that include load balancers, the connection ID can be used as a way for the server to signal information about the desired treatment of a flow to the load balancers. Guidance on assigning connection IDs is given in [QUIC-APPLICABILITY]. [QUIC-LB] describes a system for coordinating selection and use of connection IDs between load balancers and servers.

在搭建包含负载均衡器的网络时，可以将连接ID用作服务器向负载均衡器发出信号，提示它期望对流量进行的处理。《[QUIC-APPLICABILITY]()》中给出了关于分配连接ID的指导。《[QUIC-LB]()》中介绍了一种负载均衡器与服务器在选择和使用连接ID时相互配合的系统。
