On-path observation of the transport headers of packets can be used for various security functions. For example, Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks against the infrastructure or against an endpoint can be detected and mitigated by characterizing anomalous traffic. Other uses include support for security audits (e.g., verifying the compliance with cipher suites), client and application fingerprinting for inventory, and providing alerts for network intrusion detection and other next-generation firewall functions.

Current practices in detection and mitigation of DDoS attacks generally involve classification of incoming traffic (as packets, flows, or some other aggregate) into "good" (productive) and "bad" (DDoS) traffic, and then differential treatment of this traffic to forward only good traffic. This operation is often done in a separate specialized mitigation environment through which all traffic is filtered; a generalized architecture for separation of concerns in mitigation is given in [DOTS-ARCH].

Efficient classification of this DDoS traffic in the mitigation environment is key to the success of this approach. Limited first packet garbage detection as in Section 3.1.2 and stateful tracking of QUIC traffic as mentioned in Section 4.2 above may be useful during classification.

Note that using a connection ID to support connection migration renders 5-tuple-based filtering insufficient to detect active flows and requires more state to be maintained by DDoS defense systems if support of migration of QUIC flows is desired. For the common case of NAT rebinding, where the client's address changes without the client's intent or knowledge, DDoS defense systems can detect a change in the client's endpoint address by linking flows based on the server's connection IDs. However, QUIC's linkability resistance ensures that a deliberate connection migration is accompanied by a change in the connection ID. In this case, the connection ID cannot be used to distinguish valid, active traffic from new attack traffic.

It is also possible for endpoints to directly support security functions such as DoS classification and mitigation. Endpoints can cooperate with an in-network device directly by e.g., sharing information about connection IDs.

Another potential method could use an on-path network device that relies on pattern inferences in the traffic and heuristics or machine learning instead of processing observed header information.

However, it is questionable whether connection migrations must be supported during a DDoS attack. While unintended migration without a connection ID change can be supported much easier, it might be acceptable to not support migrations of active QUIC connections that are not visible to the network functions performing the DDoS detection. As soon as the connection blocking is detected by the client, the client may be able to rely on the 0-RTT data mechanism provided by QUIC. When clients migrate to a new path, they should be prepared for the migration to fail and attempt to reconnect quickly.

Beyond in-network DDoS protection mechanisms, TCP SYN cookies [RFC4987] are a well-established method of mitigating some kinds of TCP DDoS attacks. QUIC Retry packets are the functional analogue to SYN cookies, forcing clients to prove possession of their IP address before committing server state. However, there are safeguards in QUIC against unsolicited injection of these packets by intermediaries who do not have consent of the end server. See [QUIC-RETRY] for standard ways for intermediaries to send Retry packets on behalf of consenting servers.
