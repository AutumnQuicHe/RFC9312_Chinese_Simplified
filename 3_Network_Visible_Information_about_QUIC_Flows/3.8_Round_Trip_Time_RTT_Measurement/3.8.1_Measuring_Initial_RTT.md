In the common case, the delay between the client's Initial packet (containing the TLS ClientHello) and the server's Initial packet (containing the TLS ServerHello) represents the RTT component on the path between the observer and the server. The delay between the server's first Handshake packet and the Handshake packet sent by the client represents the RTT component on the path between the observer and the client. While the client may send 0-RTT packets after the Initial packet during connection re-establishment, these can be ignored for RTT measurement purposes.

在通常情况下，客户端的初始数据包（含有TLS `ClientHello`）与服务器的初始数据包（含有TLS `ServerHello`）之间的延迟就代表着观察者与服务器间路径的RTT分量。服务器的首个握手数据包与客户端发送的首个握手数据包间的延迟代表着观察者与客户端间路径的RTT分量。尽管在连接的重新建立期间，客户端可能在初始数据包后发送0-RTT数据包，但是出于RTT测量的目的，可以忽略它们。

Handshake RTT can be measured by adding the client-to-observer and observer-to-server RTT components together. This measurement necessarily includes all transport- and application-layer delay at both endpoints.

可以通过将客户端至观察者的RTT分量与观察者至服务器的RTT分量相加的方式得到握手RTT。该测量结果中必定包含了两侧终端上的所有传输层延迟和应用层延迟。
