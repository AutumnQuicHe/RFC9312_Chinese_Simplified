QUIC does not expose the end of a connection; the only indication to on-path devices that a flow has ended is that packets are no longer observed. Therefore, stateful devices on path such as NATs and firewalls must use idle timeouts to determine when to drop state for QUIC flows; see Section 4.2.

QUIC并未暴露连接的终止时机；对在路径上的设备来说唯一能够表明流量已停止的信号是不再观察到数据包这一现象。因此，NAT和防火墙等在路径上的有状态设备必须使用超时机制来判断何时移除为QUIC流量维护的状态数据；详见[第4.2章]()。
