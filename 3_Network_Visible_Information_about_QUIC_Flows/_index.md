This section addresses the different kinds of observations and inferences that can be made about QUIC flows by a passive observer in the network based on the wire image in Section 2. Here, we assume a bidirectional observer (one that can see packets in both directions in the sequence in which they are carried on the wire) unless noted, but typically without access to any keying information.

本章讨论了在网络内的被动观察者能够基于[第2章](#2_Features_of_the_QUIC_Wire_Image)介绍的通信线路图象对QUIC流量进行的不同种类的观察和介入方法。除非特别指出，否则我们在这里假设的观察者都是双向的（在两个方向上都能看到线路上的数据包序列），但一般无法访问任何关键信息。
